Welcome to PCCI PTIM-OpenSource repository!

It contains the Jupyter notebooks that is used to develop the PTIM model.  
The Parkland Trauma Index of Mortality (PTIM) is a machine learning algorithm that uses electronic medical record data to predict mortality within 48 hours during the first 3 days of hospitalization. It updates every hour, recalculating as physiology changes. 

You can access the PTIM publication to see more details regarding the modeling background from the [link](https://journals.lww.com/jorthotrauma/abstract/2022/06000/parkland_trauma_index_of_mortality__real_time.2.aspx).
